# FamineFighter

 <p align="center" width="400px"> <font size="5"> <b> We have built a platform in which people, organization,
                  restaurants, etc can come together and donate their surplus
                  food and several NGOs can take the food and distribute them among needy. Through this platform, we are planning to solve two
                  major issues, the world is facing right now. First being
                  reduction of food wastage and second being reducing hunger. We also aim to motivate people to be kind and get involve through various blogs that we provide on our webiste. Finally, we together plan to make this world worth living and provide a life that everyone deserves!<br /></p>
